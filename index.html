    <p style="color: gray;"> it took me 50 years to make those hearts nice and centered bruh xD</p>
    <p>I am learning how to use the internetz, so far so good, I was not there for the old web but I hope that I can relearn things. Become good and all. Everything here is made by me! No AI, no stock images, (I did not make the GIFs lwl). But I will make those too I swear!!! Oh and so far I only support English, but it is what it is. I will be ading some of my cool things here, like my poems film reviews and stuff. </p>
    <p> Hmm, maybe I can host my code here too, and music and movies aaaa so much stuff. My own little blog :D, well this is better than spending all of my time on YouTube! I spend wayyy too much time, and I am trying to get off the internet (more so social media than anything but still). So I will come here everyday and just add stuff or yap since I do not have many people to talk to. </p>
    <P> To be honest I do have people I could talk to, but I don't know, I do not want to disturb them and I think they find me boring. I often sound very pretentious :( even though I do not wish to. I love philosophy and stuff but I am bad at social thingies. Oh well. </P>
