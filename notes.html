<h2 style="color: azure;"> 10/6/2024 The creation of this page! (dd/mm/yyyy)</h2>
<p>Sooo I was supposed to be studying biology and English, yk to not fail the grade.
    <br> But then I got ADHDd and bought a domain connected it to cloudlflare then coded
    <br> all of this ( I barely know HTML so this took a bit, it is not that hard honestly).
</p>
<p> I really hope I do not fail :(, there is this one girl I kinda like I think. But also
    <br> I ofen feel like I have wasted my childhood even though I am 17. Idk, just
    <br> really sad all the time and very loneley. I am often very obssesive even though
    <br> I try my best to not be overwhelming, but I always fail and I feel horrid for 
    <br> putting people through all kinds of things. My intention is always the best
    <br> yet I fuck it up every time so I have distanced myself from people <b> a lot</b>.
</p>
<p> The girl which goes to my class I do kind of like but more like a platonic thing, however 
    <br> there is this other girl which I  REALLY like, her name is Sandra >><<. She is kind of cute 
    <br> but I think she does not like me that much, just like anyone else. Even though she talks
    <br> and laughs at my jokes. I get that impression as I am always the one to message first and 
    <br> send long SMS messages or write letters or try to knit her a Foo Fighters hoodie lool.
</p>

<p> Oh well, such is life. I just wish I was dead, I cry too much.</p>
