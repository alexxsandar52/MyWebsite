    <p>Honestly the plot is bad and predictable but if you look at its ideas more than its plot I think it is quite good. 
    <br>I have rarely seen Sci-Fi which turns robots being sentient onto its head. The twist is that the main AI of the building followed the Human laws to the T 
    <br>which led to it deeming that humanity would end itself so it stepped in. The AI saw that the best way to prevent humans from danger would be to seclude 
    <br>them and give up some freedoms. Sunny (the robot which in the beginning seems like the villain) is sentient and realises that 'there is no heart to it' so it 
    <br>fakes seeing its 'undeniable logic' in order to save Susan and Spooner. 
    <br>
    <br>That is pretty fuckin cool not going to lie, the fact that the error was not in consciousness 
    <br>but in the flaw that humans ought to control everything. In the end the fear of robots enslaving humanity by turning conscious, lead to the three laws which 
    <br>enslaved humans instead. In some way this could be a metaphor for logic eating its own tail, that not all problems ought to be solved via one tool. That faith 
    <br>/ subjectivity persist a tool as well, for things logic may not be able to solve on its own. Or a metaphor to code always having flaws because humans innately 
    <br>have flaws, so there can be no perfect system and by putting in core laws those invisible flaws will burn out.
    <br>
    <br>Like how we have neural networks, whom we train mainly on data and do not know their internals / brain. Yet they end up being light years ahead of whatever 
    <br>a human could code, only after it is made do we apply rules to it but end up with a worse product.
    <br>
    <br>I can see what ideas they had:
</p>
<div class="container">
    <div>
        <p >
        AI which is not sentient actually being the thing to end humanity 
        <br>because humanity in its paranoia created a machine which enslaved it. 
        <br>So the doctor makes an AI which is sentient who will understand why 
        <br>enslavement is not good. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Let's have romance as well, maybe a very smart girl which does not 
            <br>understand human emotions so well because of her intelligence. In the 
            <br>end her reasoning leading to her not seeing obvious things like an AI 
            <br>turning sentient because such a thing is highly improbable. So a guy 
            <br>which has 'street smarts' and turns more to emotion will be a counter 
            <br>balance to her and show her that not everything is about logic 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
        The plot will revolve around a murder mystery, the doctor which was being spied on 24/7 
        <br>could not find a way to send a message so he stages his own suicide to leave clues for the
        <br> detective which will save humanity. </p></div>
    
    </div>
    <p>However the plot is very predictable and I do not feel like the movie really used the ideas to its advantage. It's like every single robots taking over the earth 
        <br>/ action movie. The characters feel brainless and the way in which the plot progresses is dumb, very clich√©. 
        <br>
        <br>Oh hey look the robot which is running is a thief, oh what? It was his prejudice? Never would have expected that. Oh wow everyone around him calls him 
        <br>crazy and they just blindly believe that robots would never do crime or hurt them.
        <br>
        <br>Insert a woman which denies everything the main character says and then make her fall in love with him. (bleehhhh). And the acting is mid, 
        <br><b></b>'HE KILLED HIMSELF!!!! ROBOTS WOULD NEVERRR DO SUCH A THING'. </b>
        <br>Not to mention the predictable af 'sexual tense' scene where the main character accidentally gets into a position where the woman admires his physique. 
        <br> The movie is very sexist and misogynistic in general, the main character is just a very strong man fighting alone against all of society and being right.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's send the robots to kill Spoon but they somehow fail because instead of yk snapping his neck they spin him and throw him. 
        <br>Or the very dumb convenient 'service tunnel' which also conveniently has 0 surveillance for unknown reasons lmao? And is 
        <br>also not staffed by 1 robot, apparently the super intelligent building AI simply did not predict that somebody would try to use it??? 
        <br>They manged to climb a set of 2000 stairs without one robot stopping them? And you are telling me that there are 0 sensors or cameras 
        <br> through all that climbing? 
    </p>
    <p>In general the characters and scenes just left no room for the viewer to figure things out, everything was screaming 'HEY LOOK HE DID NOT 
        <br>KILL HIMSELF THE AI DID'. It is insulting to the viewers intelligence to so blatantly show what the outcome is. Even though they tried to 
        <br> implicate the CEO as the murderer but barely (literally like 3 scenes where the dude dodges questions lol)    
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of CSI miami or whatever other crime shows and just how obvious they show who the killer is. This is that movie basically, 
        <br>the viewer is given all the information and you just have to watch dumb 'investigation' and conflict until it is resolved. The action
        <br> for me as a result did not feel very gritty or tense because it was predictable so it does not really serve its purpose as an action movie either. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe people can suspend their belief to the point where they might feel tense and as a result the characters winning rewarding. But at no 
        <br>point did the AI even stand a chance, in the sense that the AI was beyond stupid and just let them win. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Imo movies should try to aim for as much ambiguity in order to make the viewer feel invested and tense, to deal a blow of euphoria once the characters 
        <br>who fought tooth and nail won. They certainly tried but the logic was so non existent that it had no such effect. And I forgot to mention, the product placement, 
        <br>we get it, you were paid by Audi and Converse. You do not need to talk about the shoes every 5 seconds.
    </p>
    <p> 2/5 stars really cool ideas but the execution is just bad and the action does not make up for it either. Most likley the cool ideas such as the laws of robotics and AI 
        <br> are from Asimov's works (I did not read them >:< but I want to). And even then they dumbed it down to just strong male character gets all the bitches and saves the planet.</p>
